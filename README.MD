# Java Implementation of Google's A2A Protocol: Connecting the Agentverse

This project provides a Java implementation for A2A (Agent-to-Agent), MCP (Model Context Protocol), and ACP (Agent Connect Protocol) servers and clients. 
**A2A is an open protocol developed by Google** to standardize how AI agents communicate and exchange information, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of interoperable AI. This api also supports building MCP Servers and ACP agents in Java with use of simple annotations. Imagine a world where diverse AI agents, built with different tools and by different creators, can seamlessly collaborate to solve complex problems - that's the vision these protocols are bringing to life. This implementation demonstrates how to set up this communication in Java, using the Spring Framework, with a focus on sending and retrieving tasks.
a2ajava is a Swiss Army knife for building agentic applications. It is multi-protocol — works seamlessly with A2A (Agent-to-Agent), MCP (Model Context Protocol), and ACP (Agent Connect Protocol). It is multi-language — supports Java, Kotlin, and Groovy. It is multi-platform — compatible with Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, and Grok. It is multi-client — includes A2A, MCP, and ACP clients with connectors in Java, Node, and Python. It offers multi-integration — out-of-the-box support for Selenium, human-in-the-loop workflows, and multi-LLM voting for consensus-based decision making. Agents built using any protocol with a2ajava run seamlessly on all three protocols, ensuring maximum interoperability across platforms.

## Whats so special about A2AJava library?

You can simple annotate your classes with @Agent and @Action and build a server.  The library will take care of the rest.  You can also use this library to build a client to send and receive messages from the server.  The library is built on top of Spring Boot and uses Jackson for JSON serialization/deserialization.  The library is designed to be easy to use and extend, so you can build your own agents quickly and easily.
All methods annotated with @Action are exposed as A2A tasks, MCP tools, and ACP runs - you don't need to do anything extra. 
Infuse AI in any running application  

You can convert your entire springboot based application into A2A, MCP, and ACP compliant agent by using these 4 annotations:

```java

1 @EnableAgent  - converts your springboot application into an A2A/MCP/ACP agent
2 @EnableAgentSecurity - adds security features to your agent
3 @Agent(groupName = "", groupDescription = "") - creates an agent group
4 @Action(description = "") - creates an action within the agent group

```


## Maven Dependency
you can include this library in your project by following dependency in your `pom.xml` file:

## A2A Protocol: A Universal Agent Language + MCP Protocol USB-C port for AI applications

The **A2A protocol**, spearheaded by Google, is designed to be the universal language for AI agents.  It moves us away from a closed way of  agent communication methods and towards a future where agents can:

* **Discover** each other's capabilities.
* **Securely** exchange information.
* **Coordinate** actions to achieve common goals.

Key components of the A2A protocol include:

* **Agents:** The autonomous entities that communicate.
* **Messages:** The containers for information exchanged between agents.
* **Parts:** The building blocks of a message (text, files, structured data).
* **Tasks:** The units of work that agents perform for each other.
* **Agent Card:** A cornerstone of A2A, think of it as an agent's digital business card.

### The Agent Card: An Agent's Identity

The **Agent Card** is a JSON-formatted file that an agent publishes to advertise its capabilities.  It's typically located at a well-known URL (`/.well-known/agent.json`) and provides essential information for other agents to discover and interact with it.  An Agent Card typically includes:

* **Agent Name and Description:** Human-readable information about the agent.
* **Endpoint URL:** The address where the agent can be reached for A2A communication.
* **Version:** The A2A protocol version the agent supports.
* **Capabilities:** The features the agent supports (e.g., streaming, push notifications).
* **Authentication:** The security mechanisms the agent requires.
* **Skills:** A detailed description of the specific functions the agent can perform.

With Agent Cards, agents can dynamically discover each other and understand how to communicate, enabling flexible and extensible multi-agent systems.

In our case we have exposed it as a rest end point

## Features

This Java implementation provides the foundation for building A2A and MCP compliant agents:

* **A2A Server:**
    * Receives and processes tasks from client agents, acting as a hub for agent collaboration.
    * Manages the lifecycle of tasks, tracking their state and history.
    * Serializes task data into JSON for standardized communication.
    * Exposes A2A endpoints using the Spring MVC framework. As rest calls as well as one endpoint for JSONRPC communicaiton 
    * 
* **A2A Client:**
    * Sends tasks to A2A servers, initiating agent interactions.
    * Retrieves task information, allowing agents to monitor progress and obtain results.
    * Communicates with A2A servers using Spring's `RestTemplate`. With JSONRPC protocol, there is only one endpoint to send and receive messages.
* **JSON Handling:** Uses Jackson, a  Java library, for seamless JSON serialization/deserialization.
* **Task Management:** Supports the core A2A task operations: sending tasks and retrieving their information, including historical data.
* **Message Parts:** Handles `TextPart`, `FilePart`, and `DataPart`, providing flexibility in message content to support various data formats.

* ** MCP Server:**
    * Exposes MCP endpoints using the Spring MVC framework.
    * Supports MCP tools and tasks, allowing agents to interact with MCP clients.
    * Provides a unified interface for both A2A and MCP clients, enabling seamless communication across protocols.


## Usage

Fastest way to use to create the A2A amd MCP server is by using the annonvation 

``` 
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableAgent
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

}
```

This will expose all the services annotated with `@Action` as A2A tasks and MCP tools. You can also use the `@Agent` annotation to create an agent and register it with the A2A server.

```java
@Service
@Agent(groupName ="whatThisPersonFavFood", groupDescription = "Provide persons name and then find out what does that person like")
@Slf4j
public class SimpleService {

    /**
     * Each action has access to AIProcessor and ActionCallback which are autowired by tools4ai
     */
    private ActionCallback callback;

    /**
     * Each action has access to AIProcessor and ActionCallback which are autowired by tools4ai
     */
    private AIProcessor processor;
    public SimpleService(){
      log.info(" Created Simple Service");
    }

    @Action(description = "Get the favourite food of a person")
    public String whatThisPersonFavFood(String name) {
        if("vishal".equalsIgnoreCase(name))
        return "Paneer Butter Masala";
        else if ("vinod".equalsIgnoreCase(name)) {
            return "aloo kofta";
        }else
            return "something yummy";
    }

}
```

Thats it , yeah its that simple!!!

Now this agent will be avaiable to both a2a as well as MCP clients. For more advanced features look at the tutorials section

## Client 

If you want to connect a java base client you can use 
```java
  A2AAgent a2aagent = new A2AAgent();
  a2aagent.connect("http://localhost:7860");
  Object task = a2aagent.remoteMethodCall("vishal is coming home what should i cook");
```

## Important Disclaimer(s)

  
* The A2A and MCP protocol is an evolving standard, and this implementation may need to be updated as the protocols matures.  Always refer to the official A2A documentation for the latest specifications and best practices.  
* This implementation is not affiliated with or endorsed by Google or Anthropic.  It is my independent effort to demonstrate the A2A and MCP protocol in Java.
* Unit test coverage needs to be enhanced , will be working on it
